#Introducing EZC, A multilingual C library for beginner and advanced programmers all across the world.

Project EZC is divided into four sections,
-C SIMPLIFICATION
-C MODIFICATION
-WEB DESIGN
-GAME DESIGN

#C Simplification:
Our first priority is to address the growing coding community. With thousands of new learners everyday, programming needs to be fast and easy to learn. EZC.h, a C Library, makes C simple and easy to learn, by simplifying down commonly used C programs.

#C Modification:
For those who already have experience with C, our goal was to make a set of functions which would overall make C simpler and easier to understand. By transforming functions which take 20+ lines into 1 line commands, EZC gets the job done fast and easy

#Web Design
Project EZC is hosted online, where itâ€™s easy to access and free for everyone to use. Using over 2000 lines of code, this website is the hub for all of our external links and downloads. The website uses CSS, Javascript, and HTML

#Game Design
Another important aspect of this project was to get people of all ages involved, and so we created a game that makes programming fun and easy to learn. Using simple questions presented in a game-type format, anyone of any age can get engaged in the wonderful world of programming.

#Impact on the Community
We want our project to have an impact on the GLOBAL programming community. With the ability to use Spanish, French, German, Swedish, Italian, and English in our program, we want people all over the world to be able to code, regardless of what language they speak.
